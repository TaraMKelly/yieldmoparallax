        <h2>Sapiens: A brief history of humankind</h2>
        <p>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Hebrew: קיצור תולדות האנושות, [Ḳitsur toldot ha-enoshut]) is a book by
            Yuval Noah Harari, first published in
            Hebrew in Israel in 2011 based on a series of lectures Harari taught at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
            and
            in English in 2014.[1][2]
            The book, focusing on Homo sapiens, surveys the history of humankind, starting from the Stone Age and going
            up
            to the twenty-first century.
            The account is situated within a framework that intersects the natural sciences with the social
            sciences.<br>

            The book has gathered mixed reviews. While it was positively received by the general public, scholars with
            relevant subject matter expertise
            have been very critical of its scientific and historical claims.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework: he sees the natural sciences as
            setting
            the limits of possibility for human
            activity and sees the social sciences as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline
            of
            history is the account of cultural change.<br>

            Harari surveys the history of humankind in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo
            sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens
            into four major parts:[3]<br>

        <ul>
            <li>The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE, when Sapiens evolved imagination).</li>
            <li>The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE, the development of agriculture).</li>
            <li>The unification of humankind (c. 34 CE, the gradual consolidation of human political organisations
                towards
                one global empire).</li>
            <li>The Scientific Revolution (c. 1543 CE, the emergence of objective science).</li>
        </ul>
        Afterword:<br>
        The Animal that Became a God<br>
        We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created
        far-flung trade networks. But did we
        decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not
        necessarily
        improve the well-being of <br>
        individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals.
        In the last few decades we have at least made some real progress as far as the human condition is concerned,
        with
        the reduction of famine, <br>
        plague and war. Yet the situation of other animals is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, and the
        improvement in the lot of humanity <br>
        is too recent and fragile to be certain of.<br>

        Sapiens Afterword at p. 415<br>
        Harari's main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can
        cooperate
        flexibly in large numbers.
        He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the
        Neanderthals, along with numerous other
        megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique
        capacity to believe in things existing
        purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights. He argues that these beliefs give
        rise to
        discrimination – whether that
        be racial, sexual or political and it is potentially impossible to have a completely unbiased society. Harari
        claims
        that all large-scale human
        cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions – owe
        their
        emergence to Sapiens' distinctive
        cognitive capacity for fiction.[4] Accordingly, Harari regards money as a system of mutual trust and sees
        political
        and economic systems as more or less
        identical with religions.<br>

        Harari's key claim regarding the Agricultural Revolution is that while it promoted population growth for Sapiens
        and
        co-evolving species like wheat
        and cows, it made the lives of most individuals (and animals) worse than they had been when Sapiens were mostly
        hunter-gatherers, since their diet and
        daily lives became significantly less varied. Humans' violent treatment of other animals is a theme that runs
        throughout the book.<br>

        In discussing the unification of humankind, Harari argues that over its history, the trend for Sapiens has
        increasingly been towards political and
        economic interdependence. For centuries, the majority of humans lived in empires, and capitalist globalization
        is
        effectively producing one, global
        empire. Harari argues that money, empires, and universal religions are the principal drivers of this
        process.<br>

        Harari sees the Scientific Revolution as founded on innovation in European thought, whereby elites became
        willing to
        admit to, and hence to try to
        remedy, their ignorance. He sees this as one driver of early modern European imperialism and of the current
        convergence of human cultures. Harari
        also emphasises the lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not
        significantly
        happier than in past eras.[5]
        He concludes by considering how modern technology may soon end the species as we know it, as it ushers in
        genetic
        engineering, immortality, and
        non-organic life. Humans have, in Harari's chosen metaphor, become gods: they can create species.<br>

        Harari cites Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) as one of the greatest inspirations for the book by
        showing that it was possible to "ask
        very big questions and answer them scientifically".[6]</p>
